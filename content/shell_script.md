# Shell script

> Computer program designed to be run by a Unix shell, a command-line
> interpreter. The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be

> logging, is called a wrapper.\

I personally [[my_shell_scripts|use]] a lot of shell scripts, mainly for simple
tasks or use some of them as wrappers for other programs.
