Great thing with spaced repetition is **remembering** things, which can be sort
of foundation to quickly do other things. For example, you need to understand
some high level concept to be able to do some task. If you don't remember
required information, you need to look it up, which can take time and break your
flow. Or sometimes it's not possible to look up information, because you don't
have enough time or resources.

Human brains learn best when information is reviewed at gradually increasing
intervals. This is "spacing effect".

To implement the spaced repetition strategy, you can use tools such as flash
cards or specialized software that can adapt the timing of review intervals
based on your performance.

Right now I'm using [[Obsidian]] plugin
[spaced repetition](https://www.stephenmwangi.com/obsidian-spaced-repetition/)
and various note types to generate flashcards. I also use it to select current
notes to work.
