# Time complexity

Measuring the speed of an operation (how many steps' operation will take) is
also known as measuring its ==time complexity==.
<!--SR:!2023-07-20,7,210-->

When we measure how “fast” an operation takes, we do not refer to how fast the
operation takes in terms of pure time, but instead in how many ==steps== it
takes. Measuring operations by steps, allow us to compare operations speed
independently of the hardware they are run on.
