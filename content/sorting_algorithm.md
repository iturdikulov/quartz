# Sorting algorithm

> Puts elements of a list into an order. The most frequently used orders are
> numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending.
> Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the
> [[computational_complexity|efficiency]] of other algorithms (such as search
> and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting
> is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable
> output.\
