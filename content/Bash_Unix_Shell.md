# Bash (Unix shell)

> Bash is a [[Unix]] shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU
> Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. First released in
> 1989, it has been used as the default login shell for most Linux
> distributions. Bash was one of the first programs Linus Torvalds ported to
> Linux, alongside GCC.\
> — <cite>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_\(Unix_shell\))</cite>

Personally, I use [[ZSH]] as my default shell

## Tips

Uppercase first letter of filenames:

```sh
for i in *;  # process every file in current directory
    do new=`echo "$i" | sed -e 's/^./\U&/'`; # replace first char by a capitalized version
    mv "$i" "$new";
done;
```
