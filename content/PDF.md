# Portable Document Format (PDF)

> File format developed by Adobe in 1992 to present documents, including text
> formatting and images, in a manner independent of application software,
> hardware, and operating systems. Based on the PostScript language, each PDF
> file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout flat document,
> including the text, fonts, vector graphics, raster images and other
> information needed to display it.\
> — <cite>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format)</cite>
