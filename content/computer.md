# Computer

> A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of
> arithmetic or logical operations ([[computation|computation]]) automatically.
> Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations
> known as [[computer_program|programs]]. These programs enable computers to
> perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally complete
> computer that includes the hardware, [[operating_system|operating system]]
> (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation.
> This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function
> together, such as a [[computer_network|computer network ]] or computer
> cluster.\
