# Logarithm

> Part of [[mathematics]]. They are related to exponential
> functions. A logarithm tells what exponent (or power) is needed to make a
> certain number, so logarithms are the inverse (opposite) of exponentiation.
> Historically, they were useful in multiplying or dividing large numbers.

What actually $log_{2}(1024)$ means? Try to use multiplication and division to
describe it in simple words.
&#10;
- How many times need to multiply **2** to get 1024 as result
  $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 1024$. So answer is 10.
- How many times need to divide **2** to get 1 as result
  $1024 \div 2 \div 2 \div 2 \div 2 \div 2 \div 2 \div 2 \div 2 \div 2 \div 2 \div 2 = 1$. So answer is 10.
