# My everyday life (routine)

Routine is a recommendation not a strict law. But without routine you can skip
many important things and lose your discipline and motivation.

I split my working day into 8 chunks, and I'm trying to follow them every day.

## Chunk #1. Wake-up

Initialization, want to do good wake-up, care about my body, warm-up and walk.
Wake-up with good moon, make your day better. I feel better if I wake up from
8:00 am.

Good checklist for wake-up:

- Wash your face and brush your teeth.
- Drink a glass of water.
- Do basic training, 20–35 minutes sessions (in my case run).
- Walk outside for 10–20 minutes to get enough energy from sun (Vitamin D).
- Prepare your workspace and start doing something important.

## Chunk #2. Working/Project with some income, aka Crank Session

Schedule anything unimportant and disable distractions, prepare water, breath
deeply and start working.

Main goals:

- Time amount about 3 hours.
- Reduce distractions, let know everyone you will be busy.
- Focus on main tasks, go from hard to easy or important to less important.
- Limit timing for tasks and working session.
- Take at least one big (10-15 min) break in this working session.
- Drink more water to stay hydrated.

## Chunk #3. Lunch and long break

You can prepare your lunch in the morning or in the evening. Give rest to your
eyes and mind and fuel your body and give time to food digestion.
This is good time to do something brainless, with low energy consumption.
Personally it's hard for me to do something brain-related after lunch some time,
and I need about 2 hours to recover.

## Chunk #4. Finish Working/Project

Complete main tasks, connect with people, help them. Mark completed tasks. You
can also work in this time on side projects, freelance, self-promotion or other
tasks.

## Chunk #5. Workout

Regular work-out for better energy and healthy mind. Better to do it according
[[my_physical_exercise_plan|plan]] and track your progress.

## Chunk #6. After workout

Showers, shaving, manicure, washing head, haircut.

## Chunk #6. LEARN, IRL, pet projects, fun (no fun no life), family

Starting somewhere in 18:00 pm.

Good time to learn and practice learned information by working with
[[my_pet_projects|pet projects]], relax, do everyday tasks and have fun.

Be helpful but don't forget about yourself and your family.

## Chunk #7. Planning, fill self-promotion information

Starting somewhere in 21:00 pm.

- Plan your day, week, month, year, life.
- Check your [[work#Goals|goals]], expertness, health, family and calendar.
- Place E-devices on charger.
- Review and adjust resume, working profiles, social networks.
- Upload videos, photos, articles, etc.

## Chunk #8. Rest

I stop doing anything brain energy consuming from 22:00 pm. I'm trying to take
rest.

Rest, to be ready for tomorrow, don't try to make longer your day. Try to start
sleep maximum at 00:00 am. Take a shower, drink something (glass of water or
something else). Read a book or do something relaxing.
