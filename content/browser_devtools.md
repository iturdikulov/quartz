DevTools allowing you edit web pages in live mode, debug [[JavaScript]] code and
examine page source and structure (DOM tree).

Since my primary browser is Firefox, I take more attention to Firefox DevTools.

## Basic tools

To toggle DevTools press `C-S-i`, it will open small window with previously
opened component (specific tab on top).

Use ellipsis menu on top right corner to change settings. Here also additional
buttons:
- Iframe list/select, appears when there are multiple iframes on a page
- Screenshot button, turned off by default
- Toggle Rules view (pixel ruler), turned off by default
- Measure a portion of the page, turned off by default
- Toggle Responsive Design Mode (`C-S-m`)
