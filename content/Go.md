# Go (programming language), aka Golang

> Go is a statically typed, compiled
> [[high-level_programming_language|high-level programming language]]
> designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is
> syntactically similar to C, but also has memory safety, garbage collection,
> structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. It is often referred to as
> Golang because of its former domain name, golang.org, but its proper name
> is Go.\
