# Algorithm

The words 'algorithm' and 'algorism' come from the name of a Persian
mathematician called 'Al-Khwārizmī' (he is practically from my **homeland**)
(Persian: خوارزمی, c. 780–850).

In general, it's, set of finite step-by-step instructions for solving some
problem ([[logic|logical]] or [[mathematics|mathematical]]), or to perform some
other **task** (for example something from real world, like
problem/computation). In other words a set of instructions for completing a
specific task.

Algorithm are used as specifications for performing computation and data
processing.

In computing, an algorithm is a precise list of operations that could be done by
a [[turing_machine|turing machine]]. For the purpose of
[[computation|computing]], algorithms are written in [[pseudocode]],
[[flowchart]], or [[programming_language|programming language]].

Sometimes, it’s possible to have two different algorithms that accomplish the
same task [[computational_complexity|complexity]]. One algorithm can be faster
than the other by **orders of magnitude**.

Often there is more than one way to achieve a particular computing goal, and
the algorithm you choose can seriously affect the speed of your code.
