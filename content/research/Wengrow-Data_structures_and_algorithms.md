# A Common-sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms: Level Up Your Core Programming Skills

If you thought that data structures and algorithms were all just theory, you're
missing out on what they can do for your code.

Learn to use Big O Notation to make your code run faster by orders of magnitude.
Choose from data structures such as hash tables, trees, and graphs to increase
your code's efficiency exponentially.

With simple language and clear diagrams, this book makes this complex topic
accessible, no matter your background.

This new edition features practice exercises in every chapter, and new chapters
on topics such as dynamic programming and heaps and tries.

Get the hands-on info you need to master data structures and algorithms for your
day-to-day work.

Algorithms and data structures are much more than abstract concepts. Mastering
them enables you to write code that runs faster and more efficiently, which is
particularly important for today's web and mobile apps.

Find out how your choice of arrays, linked lists, and hash tables can
dramatically affect the code you write.

Use recursion to solve tricky problems and create algorithms that run
exponentially faster than the alternatives.

Dig into advanced data structures such as binary trees and graphs
to help scale specialized applications such as social networks and mapping
software.

You'll even encounter a single keyword that can give your code a turbo boost.

Practice your new skills with exercises in every chapter, along with detailed
solutions. Use these techniques today to make your code faster and more
scalable.

# 1. Why Data Structures Matter /22

First focus when you are code is to write properly running code.

Why?

Because **efficiency**, you can write efficient or inefficient code. sort of
productive or unproductive code... For me unproductive means increase entropy of
system. Which I hate. Because programs must run fast... Efficient code looks
even better, easily to maintain and use in every-day life.

First step in writing fast code is to understand what data structures are and
how different data structures can affect to speed of our code.

## Data Structures /23

Notes leaved here [[data_structure|data structure]].

## The Array: The Foundational Data Structure /24

Some information about [[array|arrays]]

## Measuring Speed /25

When we measure how “fast” an operation takes, we do not refer to how fast the
operation takes in terms of pure time, but instead in ==how many steps it
takes==.

So if operation A take less steps than operation B, we can assume that operation
A will always be faster than operation B on all pieces of hardware.

Measuring the number of steps is key to analyzing the speed of an operation.

## Wrapping Up /39

Analyze data structure before use them. Choose most suitable.

## Exercises /40

1. For an array containing 100 elements, provide the number of steps the
   following operations would take:
   a. Reading
   b. Searching for a value not contained within the array
   c. Insertion at the beginning of the array
   d. Insertion at the end of the array
   e. Deletion at the beginning of the array
   f. Deletion at the end of the array
   ?
   a. 1 step
   b. 100 steps
   c. 100 to shift right and 1 to insert = 101
   d. 1 step, but memory allocation?
   e. 1 to delete, 99 to shift left
   f. 1 step

2. For an array-based set containing 100 elements, provide the number of steps
   the following operations would take:
   a. Reading
   b. Searching for a value not contained within the array
   c. Insertion of a new value at the beginning of the set
   d. Insertion of a new value at the end of the set
   e. Deletion at the beginning of the set
   f. Deletion at the end of the set
   ?
   a. 1 step
   b. 100 steps
   c. 100 to search, 100 to shift right and 1 to insert = 201
   d. 100 to search, 1 step to insert
   e. 1 to delete, 99 to shift left
   f. 1 step

3. Normally the search operation in an array looks for the first instance of a
   given value. But sometimes we may want to look for every instance of a given
   value. For example, say we want to count how many times the value “apple” is
   found inside an array. How many steps would it take to find all the “apples”?
   Give your answer in terms of N. Don't overthink here.
   ?
   In classic search, we can do 1 step in best case it can take 1 step. But if
   you need search all occurrence, you need to do N steps.
   If the array contains N elements, searching for all instances of the
   string “apple” in an array will **take N steps**. When searching for just one
   instance, we can **cut our search short** as soon as we find it. But if we
   need to find all instances, we have no choice but inspect **each element** of
   the entire array.

# 2. Why Algorithms Matter /41

Placed some notes here [[algorithm]].


## Ordered Arrays /42
## Searching an Ordered Array /44
## Binary Search /46
## Binary Search vs. Linear Search /51

Placed some notes in [[binary_search_algorithm|binary search algorithm]]

## Wrapping Up /54

## Exercises /54

1. How many steps would it take to perform a linear search for the number
8 in the ordered array, [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13] ?
   > I think 4, on step 4 we compare 8 with search value and return index 3.
   Linear search on this array would take four steps. We start at the beginning
   of the array and check each element from left to right. Because the 8 is the
   fourth number, we’ll find it in four steps
2. How many steps would binary search take for the previous example?
   > Probably 1, because we split array to half, and we found value instantly in
   > 1 step, by jump to index #3. But maybe it's depends on implementation.
   Binary search would take just one step in this case. We start the binary
   search at the middlemost element, and the 8 just happens to be the
   middlemost element!
3. What is the maximum number of steps it would take to perform a binary
search on an array of size 100,000?
   > With my computations, probably 17, round log2(n).
   To solve this, we need to count how many times we halve 100,000 until
   we get down to 1. If we keep dividing 100,000 by 2, we see that it takes
   us 16 times until we get down to about 1.53.
   This means a worst-case scenario would take **about 16 times**.

## Exercises /65

1. Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of the following function
   that determines whether a given year is a leap year:
   ```c
   function isLeapYear(year) {
       return (year % 100 === 0) ? (year % 400 === 0) : (year % 4 === 0);
   }
   ```
   I think it's O(1), because we do only 3 operations. And since 3 is finite
   number time complexity is constant.
2. Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of the following function
that sums up all the numbers from a given array:
   ```c
   function arraySum(array) {
       let sum = 0;
       for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
           sum += array[i];
       }
       return sum;
   }
   ```
   This looks like O(n), because we iterate over array of N, elements.
3. The following function is based on the age-old analogy used to describe
   the power of compounding interest:

   Imagine you have a chessboard and put a single grain of rice on one
   square. On the second square, you put 2 grains of rice, since that is
   double the amount of rice on the previous square. On the third square,
   you put 4 grains. On the fourth square, you put 8 grains, and on the fifth
   square, you put 16 grains, and so on.

   The following function calculates which square you’ll need to place a
   certain number of rice grains. For example, for 16 grains, the function
   will return 5, since you will place the 16 grains on the fifth square.

   Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of this function, which
   is below:

   ```javascript
   function chessboardSpace(numberOfGrains) {
       let chessboardSpaces = 1;
       let placedGrains = 1;

       while (placedGrains < numberOfGrains) {
           placedGrains *= 2;
           chessboardSpaces += 1;
       }
       return chessboardSpaces;
   }
   ```
   This looks like $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$, for example number of grains is 100,
   and we do ~ 7 iterations, etc. Like in [[binary_search_algorithm]].
4. The following function accepts an array of strings and returns a new array
that only contains the strings that start with the character "a". Use Big O
Notation to describe the time complexity of the function:
function selectAStrings(array) {
let newArray = [];
for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
if (array[i].startsWith("a")) {
newArray.push(array[i]);
}
}
return newArray;
}
The following function calculates the median from an ordered array.
Describe its time complexity in terms of Big O Notation:
function median(array) {
const middle = Math.floor(array.length / 2);
// If array has even amount of numbers:
if (array.length % 2 === 0) {
return (array[middle - 1] + array[middle]) / 2;
} else { // If array has odd amount of numbers:
return array[middle];
}
}
