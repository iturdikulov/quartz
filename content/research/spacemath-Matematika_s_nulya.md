«Математика с нуля. Пошаговое изучение математики для начинающих» – это новый
проект, предназначенный для людей, которые хотят изучить математику
самостоятельно с нуля.

# Numbers

Number - mathematical object that represents the quantity of some items (used to
count them).

One chocolate |, two glasses ||, ten eggs ||||||||||, a million rubles.

Digits - characters set used to write numbers, ==0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9==.

# Main operations

## Actions with numbers (operations)
&#10;
- Addition (+) - combining two or more numbers into one.
- Subtraction (-) - finding the difference between two numbers.
- Multiplication (*) - repeated addition of the same number.
- Division (/) - finding the number of times one number is contained in another.

## Comparison of numbers (operations)
&#10;
Main property here is relation between numbers.
- Equality ($=$) - two numbers are equal.
- Inequality ($\neq$) - two numbers are not equal.
- Greater than ($>$) - one number is greater than another, $5 > 3$, five is greater
  than 3 (related to 3).
- Less than ($<$) - one number is less than another, $3 < 5$.
- Greater than or equal to ($geq$ - one number is greater than or equal to another.
- Less than or equal to ($leq$) - one number is less than or equal to another.

In mathematics comparison can be used to represent
==formulas, equations, functions and rules==.
You can write one expression equal to another, or one expression is not equal
for some object, number or rule.
You "can't" divide $a$ by $b$, where $b$ is zero, $\frac{a}{b},b \neq 0$.
