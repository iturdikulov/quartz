[[zen_of_python|Zen of python]] describes the philosophy of Python.

This is most prioritized language for me. I learn it according to my
[[how_I_learn_programming_and_software_development#Python|roadmap]].

**Python** is a [[high-level_programming_language|high-level]],
[[general-purpose_programming_language|general-purpose]] programming language.

One of key features of Python is attention to [[readability]], by using
indentation to delimit code blocks, rather than curly brackets or keywords.

Python is [dynamically typed] and [garbage-collected].

It supports any popular [[programming_paradigm|programming paradigm]]:

- [[structured_programming|structured]]
- [[procedural_programming|procedural]]
- [[OOP|object-oriented]]
- [[functional_programming|functional]]

Rich [[research/Python_Community-Python_Standard_Library|standard library]] make
it's "batteries included" language.
